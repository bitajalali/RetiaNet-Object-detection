This project is a custom implementation of RetinaNet, an object detection model, for detecting and classifying objects in images using PyTorch. Built on a ResNet-50 backbone with a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) for multi-scale feature extraction, the model efficiently identifies objects of various sizes within images. The repository includes code to set up and train the model on a COCO-format dataset, as well as functions for visualization of bounding boxes with confidence scores on test images. This setup is ideal for applications requiring accurate object detection and classification with customization flexibility.
